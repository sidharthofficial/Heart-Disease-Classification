# Heart-Disease-Classification
Classification of heart disease using machine learning

In this project I have tried to classify whether or not a person has heart disease based on many health parameters.
The data was downloaded from freely available datasets and then it was cleansed and then trained and tested upon.
A RandomForestClassifier model was used to make the model.
First the data was visualized, and many known libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn were used.
Finally the accuracy of the model was found, and the confusion matrix plotted.
