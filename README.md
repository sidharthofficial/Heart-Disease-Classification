# Heart-Disease-Classification
Classification of heart disease using machine learning

Project on Structured data.
In this project I have tried to classify whether or not a person has heart disease based on many health parameters.
The data was downloaded from freely available datasets and then it was cleansed and then trained and tested upon.
The training dataset and the test dataset was also made on our own from a single datasheet
A RandomForestClassifier model was used to make the model.
First the data was visualized, and many known libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn were used.
Finally the accuracy of the model was found, and the confusion matrix plotted.
